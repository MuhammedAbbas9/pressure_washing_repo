• Project Title:
Entretien RJS Management System.

• Description:
This project involves the development of a web-based system that allows the customers to browse the pressure washing / landscaping services this small business offers as well as to book and/or get online estimations for their desired services.

• Objectives and Goals:
Creating a well-rounded website that showcases our client’s past cleaning jobs (before/after photos), all the various services they offer, pricing for certain servicesas well as a space to get online or in-person quotas.
Facilitating the business owner’s job by creating an admin log-in in order for him to have an organized space where he can see each customer’s contact info accompanied by their location and the services they chose as well as a service request page where he reviews the free estimation requests from future clients and decides if their contact info gets registered in the "client info" page.
